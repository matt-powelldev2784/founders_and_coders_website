Showcase website project built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Flexbox, grid and media queries are utilised to provide
a fully responsive layout. A light and dark theme can be toggled using the menu. SVG sprites are used so the icons also
change colour when the light or dark theme is toggled. I have used a carousel to display the projects. I have created
touch detection logic so the carousel can be swiped on touch devices. I have used an intersection observer to detect
when the projects section comes into view so I can toggle the display of a swipe icon to alert touch users of the swipe
functionality.
