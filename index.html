                Hi, my name is Matthew Powell, you may have noticed me posing at the top of the page! I'm
                currently working as a print production manager for a company which provides technology based
                distribution solutions for the medical and telecommunications industry. I'm looking for a
                career change as the printing industry is a shrinking market which means the job security
                isn't great. I recently became a first time dad and enjoy spending time with my daughter. I
                like to keep fit, and I am a keen swimmer and footballer. I recently met a previous Founders
                and Coders graduate who put me in touch.

              <p class="about_p">
                I have always been interested in technology and have worked with computers since a young age,
                when the command line was the only way to do things! I started learning JavaScript in 2020
                using Udemy and other online resources. I found that I really enjoyed programming and web
                design and decided to set about finding a way to get into a professional role. I genuinely
                enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies and get a buzz when solving problems or
                completing new features in my projects.

              <p class="about_p">
                It's amazing to think 2 years ago I didn't know a single bit of JavaScript syntax. Since then
                I have developed full stack projects using JavaScript, React, Redux, TypeScript and Node JS.
                It's been an exciting and interesting journey which is on-going. My 3 biggest challenges so
                far have been implementing the React Drag and Drop Library in one of my projects, migrating
                one of my projects from React Context to Redux and migrating the same project to TypeScript.
                My background in the print industry means I have substantial knowledge about fonts, images and
                page layouts. I also have experience using Photoshop, Illustrator and other Adobe Creative
                Cloud Applications.

                The Founders and Coders projects have given me a chance to focus more on my design skills.
                Previously I have paid less attention to this and more on learning the coding syntax and
                concepts. It has also allowed me to take a deeper dive into some of the Vanilla JavaScript
                bits I missed first time round.
